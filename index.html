            <p>The current president of our club is Apaar M., we're a group of individuals brought together by our love of creation. Whether is be by creating the music, the art, this website, or making the actual code of the game itself, we like to create.</p>
            <p>We were created in the 2013 - 2014 school year, and started with only x amount of people, but we've now grown to be a team of y amount of people!</p>

          <div class="TabbedPanelsContent"><p>Currently we're making progress on a game about a boy who wasn't all too pleased with what Santa got him. We can't speak <em>too</em> much about the game itself, but we can say that when it's finished, it'll be a fun game with tons of secrets to discover!</p></div>
         <div class="TabbedPanelsContent"><p>There's nothing here at the moment. Come back later after we actual unveil the website in club.</p></div>
